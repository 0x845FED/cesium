# Presenter's Guide

The Cesium team gives a lot of [talks](http://cesiumjs.org/publications.html).  Here's some tips for delivering a great talk based on our experience.

## Invest Time Preparing

If you give a 30-minute talk to 100 people, **they cumulatively spend 50 hours watching it**.  If you post the video and slides online, many others will also spend their time.

People may blog about your talk.  They might cite it in their own talks.

Your future talks may be based on your previous talks.  You may also create website content from it.

Given how much value a talk can bring, it is worth investing time to prepare.  A one-hour talk from scratch on a deep technical topic can take 15 hours to prepare.  A 30-minute Cesium overview based on a previous talk may only take two hours to update.

## Know the Audience

You'll give a different talk to a group of researchers than to a group of developers than to a group of users.  Find out as much as you can about the audience.  If you are presenting at a conference, ask the organizers and people who have presented there.  If you are presenting at an organization, ask your point of contact.  The mistake often made isn't forgetting to tailor the talk to the audience; **the mistake is tailoring it to the wrong audience**.

## Provide Context

Chances are that your topic is second nature to you; you work on it all day.

Your audience does not.

Things that are obvious to you are often not obvious to your audience.

Focus less on details, and instead **focus on providing context**, especially at the start of your talk.  Otherwise, you will loose the audience the moment they [can't see the forest for the trees](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=can%27t+see+the+forest+for+the+trees).

## Tell a Story

Your audience loves stories.

Tell one.

Early in a presentation, **a story will help build context**.  For example, see Slides 2-6 of [3D Tiles](http://cesiumjs.org/presentations/SIGGRAPH2015/Cesium3DTiles.pdf).

Stories will help you connect with your audience.  It will make them more likely to [engage you](#engage-the-audience).

## You're Not Too Short on Time

Novice presenters, in particular, often think they need a lot of material.  They worry about running short.

In the vast majority of cases, the exact opposite happens; the talk includes too much material for the allowed time, and the presenter is forced go too fast, minimize questions, and cut material.

**Keep it short**.

Slow down.

If it breaks your heart to cut slides, move them to the end as _Bonus Slides_.

## Use "Short" Slides

Good writing uses short paragraphs so the reader feels like they are constantly making progress.

Good presenters do the same.  **Don't spend too much time on any one slide**; the audience will tune you out.  Break uber slides into multiple slides.

Think of each slide and the entire presentation as a one-page resume; a resume is only one-page so it highlights your best work, instead of letting your best work get lost in the noise of all your work.

## Inspire.  Don't Teach

Novice presenters often think they need to go really deep into the material.  This is wrong for almost all talks.

Even a presentation for a research paper includes far less detail than the paper; _it is a pitch to read the paper_.

**Too much detail will overwhelm your audience** and likely put you in a time crunch.  Instead, provide enough [context and detail](#provide-context) to inspire the audience to take your [call to action](#finish-with-a-call-to-action).

## Show.  Don't Tell

**A slide with too many words overwhelms the audience**.  The audience may try to read it and tune you out in the process - or they may just feel that this part of the talk is too much work to take in, and tune everything out.

Whenever possible, **replace words with images**.  Put the words in the notes section for posting online and for your review next time you give a similar talk.

When reasonable, replace images with videos, and replace videos with demos.  Demos need to be carefully practiced so they can be delivered smoothly.  Long pauses as you navigate the UI will tune out the audience.

## Finish With a Call to Action

Use the last slide to pitch a call to action.  Do you want the audience to check out Cesium?  Provide feedback on a new format?  Apply for a job?

Ask them.  But do not ask them to do too many things.  **What is the one most important action?  Ask for it.**

## Practice

A novice speaker will significantly benefit from multiple dry runs.

First, ask your colleagues for feedback on your slides.

Then, organize a _timed_ dry run.  Invite your colleagues and ask them to take to take notes and provide feedback.

Then iterate with multiple dry runs until you are satisfied or run out of time.

A dry run with colleagues is harder than the real presentation.  **Expect your presentation to go better than your best dry run.**

## Test the Projector

Present on your own laptop whenever possible.

Ask in advance about the projector connections and Internet access.  Bring adapters, not everyone has HDMI.

Ask for a time when you can test the projector, perhaps before the morning session or during a break.

## Engage the Audience

For an audience of 20 or less, a great talk will turn into a group discussion with you as the facilitator.

Engage the audience.

Ask them questions.

**[Tell stories](#tell-a-story) to create an inclusive inviting environment**.

Ask "who has the first question", not "are there any questions."

## Be Passionate

Give talks on topics you are passionate about.  **Be excited.**  Your passion will naturally show through and will help inspire your audience.

The first time you give a talk is often the best because the material is fresh (see the [second-lecture effect](http://blog.virtualglobebook.com/2012/07/reflections-on-teaching-gpu-programming.html)).

To delivery the same talk well a second time, it is important to spend the time to review and update the material so you are not presenting cold and recalling what to say once you see the slide.

Once you've spoke about a topic many times, it may be time to give someone else a chance to present.

## You are the Expert

In almost all talks you give, you will be the expert on the topic in the room, even if you don't think you are.  You prepared the talk.  You presumably have some experience with the topic even if you are not the originator of the work (this is common in grad school where students present recently published research papers).

**Be confident**.

But don't be arrogant.

Don't worry about failing.

## Present with a Partner

When presenting with a partner, strive to make it like a conversation.  For a great example, see how [Brian Fitzpatrick and Ben Collins-Sussman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTCuYzAw31Y) do it.
